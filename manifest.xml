  <description brief="meshing.pg2013">
    This repository contains the Las Vegas Reconstruction Toolskit.
    We are temporary using this until we reach a stable version and
    will then create a Debian package that will be uploaded to our
    own package mirror.
    After a successfull compile you need to tell your ros package
    'lvr_tools' this working path. Just run the following command:
    # echo "export LVR_PATH=/path/to/meshing.pg2013" >> ~/.bashrc
    
    This issue will be solved by creating a .deb package, meanwhile
    we just need to accept it... ;-)
