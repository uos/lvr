    This repository contains the Las Vegas Reconstruction Toolskit.
    We are temporary using this until we reach a stable version and
    will then create a Debian package that will be uploaded to our
    own package mirror.

    A successful 'rosmake' will eventually create the environment
    variable $LVR_PATH pointing to this directory.

    This issue will be solved by creating a .deb package, meanwhile
    we just need to accept this... ;-)
