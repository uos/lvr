/**
 * @brief A table coding the relations between shared vertices of
 *        adjacent positions in the grid created during the marching
 *        cubes reconstruction process
 *
 * Each box corner in the grid is shared with 7 other boxes.
 * To find an already existing corner, these boxes have to
 * be checked. The following table holds the information where
 * to look for a given corner. The coding is as follows:
 *
 * Table row = query vertex
 *
 * Each row consists of 7 quadruples. The first three numbers
 * indicate, how the indices in x- y- and z-direction have to
 * be modified. The fourth entry is the vertex of the box
 * correspondig to the modified indices.
 *
 * <i>Example</i>: index_x = 10, index_y = 7, index_z = 5
 *
 * <i>Query vertex</i> = 5
 *
 * First quadruple: {+1, 0, +1, 0} Indices pointing to the nb-box:
 * 10 + 1, 7 + 0, 5 + 1.
 * --> The first shared vertex is vertex number 0 of the box in position
 * (11, 7, 6) of the grid.
 *
 * Simple isn't it?
