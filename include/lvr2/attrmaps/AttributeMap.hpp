/**
 * @brief Interface for attribute maps.
 *
 * Attribute maps are associative containers which map from a handle to a
 * value. A simple and obvious implementation of this interface is a hash map.
 *
 * Attribute maps are used a lot in this library and are widely useful. A good
 * example is an algorithm that needs to visit every face by traversing a mesh,
 * but has to make sure to visit every face only once. In that algorithm, the
 * best idea is to use an attribute map which maps from face to bool. This
 * means that we associate a boolean value with each face. This boolean value
 * can be used to store whether or not we already visited that face. Such a
 * map would have the form `AttributeMap<FaceHandle, bool>`.
 *
 * Attribute maps are also used to store non-temporary data, like face-normals,
 * vertex-colors, and much more. It's pretty simple, really: if you want to
 * associate a value of type `T` with a, say, vertex, simply create an
 * `AttributeMap<VertexHandle, T>`.
 *
 * There are different implementations of this interface. The most important
 * ones have a type alias in `AttrMaps.hpp`. Please read the documentation in
 * that file to learn more about different implementations.
 *
 * @tparam HandleT Key type of this map. Has to inherit from `BaseHandle`!
 * @tparam ValueT The type to map to.
