/**
 * @brief A vector which guarantees stable indices and features O(1) deletion.
 *
 * This is basically a wrapper for the std::vector, which marks an element as
 * deleted but does not actually delete it. This means that indices are never
 * invalidated. When inserting an element, you get its index (its so called
 * "handle") back. This handle can later be used to access the element. This
 * remains true regardless of other insertions and deletions happening in
 * between.
 *
 * USE WITH CAUTION: This NEVER frees memory of deleted values (except on its
 * own destruction and can get very large if used incorrectly! If deletions in
 * your use-case are far more numerous than insertions, this data structure is
 * probably not fitting your needs. The memory requirement of this class is
 * O(n_p) where n_p is the number of `push()` calls.
 *
 * @tparam HandleT This handle type contains the actual index. It has to be
 *                 derived from `BaseHandle`!
 * @tparam ElemT Type of elements in the vector.
