/**
 * @brief A strongly-typed vector, representing a position vector.
 *
 * This type represents a position vector as opposed to a direction vector.
 * This is a subtle but important difference. There are operations that don't
 * make sense for certain combinations of position/direction vectors. In order
 * to avoid logic bugs, this type and `Vector` delete certain operations from
 * the backing type.
 *
 * For more information and intuitive examples why this type safety makes
 * sense, see [1].
