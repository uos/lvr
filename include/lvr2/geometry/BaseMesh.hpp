/**
 * @brief Interface for triangle-meshes with adjacency information.
 *
 * This interface represents meshes that contain information about the
 * conectivity of their faces, edges and vertices. They make it possible to
 * access adjacent faces/edges/vertices in constant time.
 *
 * Faces, edges and vertices in these meshes are explicitly represented (the
 * phrase "faces, edge or vertex" is often abbreviated "FEV"). To talk about
 * one specific FEV, so called handles are used. A handle is basically an index
 * which is used to identify a FEV. Note that the internal structures used to
 * represent FEVs are not exposed in this interface. This means you'll never
 * write something like `vertex.outgoingEdge`, but you'll always use methods
 * of this interface to get information about a FEV.
 *
 * Meshes are mainly used to store connectivity information. They are not used
 * to store arbitrary data for each FEV. To do that, you should use FEV maps
 * which allow you to associate arbitrary data with a FEV (and more). For more
 * information about that, please refer to the documentation in `VectorMap`.
 * There is one important exception, though: the 3D position of vertices is
 * stored inside the mesh directly. This is actually rather inconsistent with
 * the whole design, but positions are used a lot -- so it is convenient to
 * store them in the mesh. But this might change in the future.
 *
 * This interface cannot be used for arbitrarily connected meshes. Instead,
 * only manifold meshes can be represented. In particular, this means that each
 * connected component of the mesh has to be a planar graph (you could draw it
 * on a piece of paper without edges crossing). As a consequence we can use
 * terms like "clockwise" and "counter-clockwise" (a property that I think is
 * called "orientable"). When doing that, we assume a planar embedding that
 * shows the face's normals sticking "out of the paper". In easier terms: draw
 * the graph (represented by the mesh) on a paper and  draw it in the way such
 * that you can see the front of all faces. When we talk about "clockwise" and
 * "counter-clockwise" we are talking about this embedding -- when looking at
 * the face.
