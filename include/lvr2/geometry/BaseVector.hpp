/**
 * @brief A generic, weakly-typed vector.
 *
 * This vector is weakly-typed as it allows all common operations that can be
 * executed numerically, including operations that won't make sense
 * semantically. You're advised to use `Point` and `Vector` instead of
 * this type directly.
 *
 * This type is used as "backing type" meaning that it is the actual
 * implementation of the vector type. `Vector` and `Point` are just wrappers
 * which delete and/or modify a few methods to make use of strong typing.
 *
 * Instead of this `BaseVector` implementations from other libraries could be
 * used. However, they have to provide all the methods and fields that
 * `BaseVector` defines.
