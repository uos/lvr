 * it assumes that each boundary-contour except the one with most edges is a
 * hole. These holes are then filled by collapsing all of their boundary edges
 * until no collapsable edge is left (which happens in any case when the hole
 * has only three edges left). If the remaining hole has only three edges after
 * the previous step, it is filled by simply inserting a triangle.
 *
 * Important: this algorithm assumes that the mesh doesn't contain any lonely
 * edges.
 *
