 * @brief Collapses `count` many edges of `mesh` for which `collapseCost`
 *        returns the smallest values.
 *
 * This algorithm collapses edges in the given mesh. The order of edge
 * collapses is determined by `collapseCost`: the edge with the smallest cost
 * is collapsed first. After each collapse, the cost function is called again
 * to update the costs for all edges that could have been affected, which are
 * the edges of all faces which touch the vertex the edge was collapsed to.
 *
 * This algorithm stops when either `count` many edges have been collapsed or
 * if the mesh has no edges left.
 *
 * @param count Number of edges to collapse
 * @param collapseCost Function which gets an edge handle and returns a float
