/**
 * @brief Collapses `count` many edges of `mesh` for which `collapseCost`
 *        returns the smallest values.
 *
 * This algorithm collapses edges in the given mesh. The order of edge
 * collapses is determined by `collapseCost`: the edge with the smallest cost
 * is collapsed first, if that is possible. In case the edge is not
 * collapsable, it is ignored and the next edge is choosen. After each
 * collapse, the cost function is called again to update the costs for all
 * edges that could have been affected, which are the edges of all faces which
 * touch the vertex the edge was collapsed to.
 *
 * This algorithm stops when either `count` many edges have been collapsed or
 * if there are no collapsable edges left.
 *
 * @param count Number of edges to collapse
 * @param collapseCost Function which is called with an edge handle and returns
 *                     a float.
 *
 * @return The number of edges actually collapsed.
