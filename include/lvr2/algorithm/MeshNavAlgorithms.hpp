 * edge leaves the neighborhood radius, every further on connected vertex and edge isn't part of the local
 * neighborhood, even if the topological "edge->vertex->edge->vertex->..."-chain, which left the radius once,
 * reenters the radius.

 * @param vH        The given VertexHandle to which we want to get the local heighborhood.
