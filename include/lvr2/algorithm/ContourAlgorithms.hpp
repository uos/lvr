/**
 * @brief Walks on a boundary contour starting at `startH`.
 *
 * To make the method more generic, it has a `exists` function object which can
 * filter out faces. Each face for which `exists` returns `false` is treated as
 * if it wouldn't exist in the mesh at all! If you don't want to ignore faces,
 * you can just not provide the `exists` parameter to use the other overload.
 *
 * The given `startH` as well as all other edges on the contour mustn't be a
 * lonely edge (when ignoring faces according to `exists`).
 *
 * The edges of the contour are visited in counter-clockwise order. That is, if
 * you look at the contour as if it were a hole in the mesh. If you are
 * thinking of the contour as an outer contour, it's in clockwise order. This
 * matter is pretty confusing and I don't know how to explain it a lot better.
 * Here another attempt:
 *
 * Inner contours are visited in counter-clockwise order and outer ones in
 * clockwise order. Inner contours are commonly referred to as "holes in the
 * mesh", while the outer one is often called "mesh boundary". However, for 3D
 * meshes, the distinction isn't all that clear. What matters here is the
 * planar embedding of the mesh. There are many possible planar embeddings,
 * including the ones that make the "mesh boundary" look like a hole and vice
 * versa.
 *
 * Anyway, we can say this for sure: given one concrete embedding for your
 * mesh, the outer contour's edges are returned in clockwise order and the
 * edges of all inner contours are returned in counter-clockwise order.
 *
 * @param visitor A function object taking two parameters: a `VertexHandle`
 *                and an `EdgeHandle`. The vertex is the vertex of the edge
 *                that comes "before" the edge, speaking about the
 *                direction of visiting the edges.
 * @param exists A function object taking one FaceHandle as parameter and
 *               returning bool. This function decides whether a face should be
 *               treated as existing or not. This is mainly used to walk on the
 *               boundary of clusters. This can be achieved by making `exists`
 *               return `false` for all faces not in the cluster.
