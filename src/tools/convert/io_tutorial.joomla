This tutorial describes how to use the i/o functionalities of the
las-vegas-reconstruction library to read and write point clouds and meshes from
various file formats. 
</p>

<hr id="system-readmore" />
<p>
The following table shows which file formats are supported at the moment and
for what kind of data they can be used:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
                       Points           Meshes
                     read    write    read    write
PLY   (.ply)          x       x        x       x
Ascii (.pts, .3d)     x       x
Obj   (.obj)                           x
UOS                   x
PCD   (.pcd)          x*      x
</pre>

 *) PCD files can only be read if the project was build with PCL.
</p>

<p>
So let's say you want to read a PLY file (“test.ply”). The first thing you have
to do is to include the specific header file. For reading PLY it is “PLYIO.hpp”
from the directory “io”. Actually everything we use in this tutorial is in the
“io” directory.
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    #include &lt;io/PLYIO.hpp&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Next we have to create a PLYIO object and use it to read the file:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    lvr::PLYIO io;
    lvr::ModelPtr model;
    model = io.read( "test.ply" );
</pre>

<p>
This will do. With this three lines of code we can read a PLY file, regardless
of the PLY format, into memory. To access the read data we can get them from
the model. “model->m_pointCloud“ will let you access a read point cloud
“model->m_mesh” a read mesh. <br />
So if you for example want to print out the coordinates of all read points you
can do it like this:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    int i;
    size_t npoints;
    lvr::coord3fArr point_coords;

    /* Make shure there were point data in the read file. */
    if ( model->m_pointCloud ) {
        /* Get coordinates. */
        coords = model->m_pointCloud->getIndexedPointArray( npoints );
        for ( i = 0; i < npoints; i++ ) {
            printf( "%f %f %f\n", coords.x, coords.y, coords.z );
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
You do not need to free the memory allocated for the point and mesh buffer. For
this purpose “boost::shared_ptr” is used. Thus the memory is freed
automatically when there is no reference to the buffer.
</p>


<p>
To make file handling even simpler you can use the “ModelFactory” to
automatically determine which i/o class to use for reading a given file and
getting a model out. For the determination of the appropriate i/o class the
file extension is used. That means that files ending with “.ply” are
automatically handled via the PLYIO class, files with the ending “.pts” are
handles via the AsciiIO, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
To use the ModelFactory you can simply create such an object call its
“readModel” function like this:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    lvr::ModelFactory io_factory;
    lvr::ModelPtr model( io_factory.readModel( filename ) );
</pre>


<p>
So it is really easy to handle files. Concluding I want to give a really simple
example of a conversion application which reads a file and stores it as another
format. This tool can be found in a slightly extended version in
“src/convert/convert.cpp”.
</p>

<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    #include &lt;io/ModelFactory.hpp&gt;


    int main( int argc, char ** argv )
    {

        lvr::ModelFactory io_factory;
        
        printf( "Loading point cloud from „%s“…\n", argv[1] );
        lvr::ModelPtr model( io_factory.readModel( argv[1] ) );

        printf( "Writing point cloud to „%s“…\n", argv[2] );
        io_factory.saveModel( model, argv[2] );

        return EXIT_SUCCESS;

    }
</pre>
